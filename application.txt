In the week of May 10-17th 2022, two consecutive conferences will be held near the campus of Los Alamos National Laboratory: The Center for Nonlinear Studies Conference in Physics-Informed Machine Learning (CNLS PIML), and University of Arizona Los Alamos Days (UA--LA Days). This proposal seeks funding for three graduate students to travel to Los Alamos and attend both conferences.

The Physics Informed Machine Learning conference, hosted in Santa Fe, NM on May 11-13th, by the Center for Nonlinear Studies (CNLS) at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), will unite theorists and practitioners across the applied sciences - from fluid mechanics to energy systems - to share recent advances in Physics-Informed Machine Learning (PIML). PIML blends machine learning models with physical symmetries and assumptions to develop fast, efficient, and interpretable statistical models to approximate physical data. Further, CNLS is uniquely suited to host, as they build upon over 40 years of expertise on the forefront of applied science.

University of Arizona Los Alamos Days is an opportunity - hosted on-campus in Los Alamos, NM May 16-17th - for researchers at the two institutions to meet, present their research, learn from one another, and cultivate collaborations. While this conference will surely give us a chance to reflect and explore applications of topics covered at the CNLS PIML conference, the audience at UA--LA Days is much broader. This two-day session spans an enormous range of topics, highlighting the rich collaboration between the two institutions.

We will argue the utility of our attendance at these conferences first from an individual perspective, and then detail the broader impact to the University of Arizona and the Program in Applied Mathematics.

Person A is moving into their 5th and final year as an applied math PhD student. As they look to transition into a role as a professional researcher, these conferences serve to (1) present and enhance their research "Physics-Informed Machine Learning with Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics: Machine Learning Lagrangian Turbulence", (2) network with experts such as Dr. Daniel Livescu, Dr. Yifeng Tian and Dr. Arvind Mohan, to explore future collaborations, and (3) establish foundations for future career opportunities at Los Alamos National Laboratory.

Person B is coming into their 4th year as an applied math PhD student, and is excited to use the PIML conference to (1) hone in on a dissertation topic, (2) present their research "Physics-Informed Machine Learning of the Coarse-Grained Velocity Gradient Tensor", and (3) learn about the most recent advances in the field of PIML. Further, the UA--LA days will serve to (4) broaden their research horizons, and (5) investigate opportunities for internships and staff positions. Finally, individual meetings with Dr. Daniel Livescu, Dr. Yifeng Tian, Dr. Anatoly Zlotnik, and Dr. Kaarthik Sundar during and between the two conferences will serve to advance the above points.

Person C is nearing their 3rd year in the applied math PhD program. They emphasize the utility of the PIML conference in that (1) the breadth and experience present facilitates the exploration of potential dissertation ideas, (2) the strong connections between UA and LANL insist that many of those in attendance will become collaborators. Additionally, they highlight that CNLS is constantly at the bleeding edge in applied mathematics so that (3) their attendance will contribute to an ongoing study of active topics in the field. In similar manner to Persons A and B, they are (4) excited by the strengthening of ties to LANL and the prospect of internships and future employment. In this vein, they also intend to (5) initiate discussions and collaborations with LANL-affiliated experts such as Dr. Carleton Coffrin, Dr. Russell Bent, and Dr. Deepjyoti Deka.

The University of Arizona, and specifically the Program in Applied Mathematics directly benefits from our attendance, as our immediate work in both of the conferences lays the foundation for future grants and research partnerships. More subtly, our engagement continues to augment an already fertile relationship between the University and LANL. In particular, at UA--LA Days, we - midway through our program - get to demonstrate to our peers and incoming graduate students, the wealth of possibilities in partnering with a national lab.

Because our itineraries are largely individual, and because of the need to regularly travel between Los Alamos and Santa Fe, we will be driving from Tucson to Los Alamos individually. Based on quotes, this is in fact the cheaper option than flying Tucson-Albuquerque and renting a car for travel between Los Alamos, Santa Fe, and Albuquerque. Thus, our expenses are of four types: mileage, lodging, meals, and conference registration. The distance from Tucson to Los Alamos (and back) is 1088 miles. We will be staying 7 nights, and conference registration for CNLS PIML is $300. Thus, our calculation yields a total cost of $1762 per person. We therefore request from GPSC the maximum allocation of $1500 per person, and plan to cover the rest out of pocket. We are concurrently seeking travel funding via additional grants, however at this time, we have not received confirmation from these sources. In the case where multiple funding sources are secured, GSPC will be the first to be refunded.

It is worth explicitly noting that these two conferences are separated by two days. During this time, we plan to engage in the fertile scientific community at LANL, conducting many of the individual meetings with researchers enumerated above, as well as meeting together as a group with our common advisor, and sharing our takeaways and elaborating on the CNLS PIML topics.

We hope that we have impressed upon you the amount of opportunity this week in Los Alamos contains for each of us. The collaborations, presentations, and networking that we expect will surely advance each of our careers in the field of physics-informed machine learning.
